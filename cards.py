# Card definitions
# Each specific card inherits from a number of base classes.
# 
# Typically, it inherits from three of them explicitly:
#  Toplevel (to define 'topmodule')
#  Connectors (to define 'connectors' and 'pins')
#  Chip (to define 'chip' and 'iseversions'
# And sometimes from:
#  Extra (to define 'bitgen_extra')
#
# and the card class itself must define:
#  name - the name of the card's vhdl file, without the "card.vhdl" suffix
#  path - the directory name for this card's bitfiles
#  card - the prefix of the bitfile name, and also the .ucf name
#  humanname - the name of the card for human consumption
#
# What's still missing is a way to define extra arguments based on ISE version
