hostmot2-firmware: build assorted hostmot2 FPGA firmwares automatically

== Overview ==

This package includes the hostmot2 source files along with Makefiles and
other scripts to automatically build all the desired variants of the
firmwares.

It requires the no-cost version of Xilinx ISE.  I build with ISE 9.2.  This
version supports all FPGAs on Mesa cards with the exception of the 3x20-2M.
Newer versions appear to work, but with caveats (see below)

It also requires ghdl for building PIN and xml files.  The PIN file
format is intended to be human readable (not machine readable) so it is
not a requirement that it exactly match the format of existing PIN
files.  There is also an experimental xml description format.


== Building ==

First, you must create a set of symlinks to the required versions of ise.
At this time, all firmwares can be built with ISE 10.1 plus ISE 13.3.
For each major version, create a symlink, e.g.,
    settings10.sh -> /opt/Xilinx10i/settings32.sh
    settings13.sh -> /opt/Xilinx13i/settings32.sh

To build all bitfiles, pinfiles, and xmlfiles:
    make -j4                   # -j setting depends on RAM and # CPU cores
On my system (quad core AMD Phenom 9600) building the full set of
firmwares took about 75 minutes wall time with the -j4 setting shown
above.

To build just a subset of firmwares, edit 'firmwares.txt' before
building.  For example, to build just the 'SV12' firmware for the '5i23' card,
put just this line in 'firmwares.txt':
    i23 SV12

To build Debian packages:
    debian/gencontrol
    export MAKEFLAGS=-j4 dpkg-buildpackage
                               # -j setting depends on RAM and # CPU cores

To build tar packages (must be in a git checkout):
    . ~/Xilinx92i/settings.sh  # depends on ISE version and install path
    make -j4                   # -j setting depends on RAM and # CPU cores
    make dist
    # or make dist-force if your working tree is dirty


== Obtaining ISE 9.2 WebPack ==

Xilinx still offers older versions of ISE free of charge.  At the time
of writing, the location is
    http://www.xilinx.com/webpack/classics/wpclassic/index.htm
and can also be reached from the xilinx.com front page by going to
"Products & Services", "Design Tools", "Logic Design Tools", "ISE
Classics", "Previous versions of ISE WebPack".


== Newer versions of ISE ==

ISE 12.3 WebPack appears to work (generate bitfiles), but with caveats:
 * ISE 11 and later remove support for Spartan-II chips, which means that
   firmwares for 5i20 and 4i65 boards cannot be built
 * ISE 11 and later remove support for the "-r" option of map.  At the present
   time, the use of this option is hardcoded and must be edited out of 'build.py':
        -run("map", "-r", "work.ngd")
        +run("map", "work.ngd")
 * Possibly due to the unsupported "-r" option, the i43_200/SVST4_6
   configuration fails at the 'map' step when built with ISE12.3.


== Testing ==

A representative firmware for each supported board type has been tested:
 * 5i20, 5i22-1M, 5i23 (PCI)
 * 7i43-400 (EPP)
 * 3x20-1M (PCI-Express)
 * 4i65, 4i68 (PC104+)
The 5i22-1.5M and 7i43-200 are not tested, but are expected to work.
