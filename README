hostmot2-firmware: build assorted hostmot2 FPGA firmwares automatically

emc 2.4 will include over 30 FPGA firmware images.  This package
includes the hostmot2 source files along with Makefiles and other
scripts to automatically build all the desired variants of the
firmwares.

It requires the no-cost version of Xilinx ISE.  I have tested with ISE
9.2.

It also requires ghdl for building PIN files.  The PIN file format is
intended to be human readable (not machine readable) so it is not a
requirement that it exactly match the format of existing PIN files.

To build all bitfiles and pinfiles:
    . ~/Xilinx92i/config.sh  # depends on ISE version and install path
    make -j4                 # -j setting depends on RAM and # CPU cores
On my system (quad core AMD Phenom 9600) building the full set of
firmwares took about 75 minutes wall time with the -j4 setting shown
above.

This package will probably be rolled into emc2 after it matures, but for
now it stands alone to make distributing it easier.


TODO:
 * basic test of firmware images
   * I have hardware to test 5i20, 7i43-400 only
