hostmot2-firmware: build assorted hostmot2 FPGA firmwares automatically

This package includes the hostmot2 source files along with Makefiles and
other scripts to automatically build all the desired variants of the
firmwares.

It requires the no-cost version of Xilinx ISE.  I have tested with ISE
9.2.  This version supports all FPGAs on Mesa cards with the exception
of the 3x20-2M.

It also requires ghdl for building PIN and xml files.  The PIN file
format is intended to be human readable (not machine readable) so it is
not a requirement that it exactly match the format of existing PIN
files.  There is also an experimental xml description format.

To build all bitfiles, pinfiles, and xmlfiles:
    . ~/Xilinx92i/settings.sh  # depends on ISE version and install path
    make -j4                   # -j setting depends on RAM and # CPU cores
On my system (quad core AMD Phenom 9600) building the full set of
firmwares took about 75 minutes wall time with the -j4 setting shown
above.

To build just a subset of firmwares, edit 'firmwares.txt' before
building.

To build Debian packages:
    . ~/Xilinx92i/settings.sh  # depends on ISE version and install path
    debian/gencontrol
    export MAKEFLAGS=-j4 dpkg-buildpackage
                               # -j setting depends on RAM and # CPU cores

To build tar packages (must be in a git checkout):
    . ~/Xilinx92i/settings.sh  # depends on ISE version and install path
    make -j4                   # -j setting depends on RAM and # CPU cores
    make dist
    # or make dist-force if your working tree is dirty

A representative firmware for each supported board type has been tested:
 * 5i20, 5i22-1M, 5i23 (PCI)
 * 7i43-400 (EPP)
 * 3x20-1M (PCI-Express)
 * 4i65, 4i68 (PC104+)
The 5i22-1.5M and 7i43-200 are not tested, but are expected to work.
